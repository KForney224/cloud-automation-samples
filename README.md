# Welcome to cloud-automation-samples

## Overview

The cloud-automation-samples github project contains code to provision and manage applications in a multi-cloud environment through VMware cloud solutions. The VMware cloud-automation-samples team invites you to use this code as is, modify it for your use cases, and to contribute new code and documentation that aligns to the purpose of this project.

## Navigating the Project

cloud-automation-samples is organized by VMware Product name and third party products for easy navigation. Enter the product folder to review and download code that can be used immediately in the referenced products. For the full application deployment sample, multiple VMware and non-VMware products are used together to provision, manage, and monitor the TITO application through a Codestream CI/CD pipeline.

### Prerequisites

To use this code to its fullest potential, you must have an account on the correct VMware Solutions as well as any third party products you wish to integration. If you do not have a VMware cloud solutions account, you can access the solution pages to obtain a free trial.

VMware Cloud Assembly (https://cloud.vmware.com/cloud-assembly)
VMware Code Stream (https://cloud.vmware.com/code-stream)
Wavefront by VMware (https://cloud.vmware.com/wavefront)
vRealize Orchestrator (https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html)

You must contact the non-VMware vendors directly to obtain access to their products.

This code is written to deploy to multi-cloud environments. Therefore, having accounts in AWS, Azure, and GCP is a great way to unlock the full potential of Cloud Assembly's cloud agnositc infrastructure-as-code. However, it is not necessary. You can also use your current vSphere environment for many of the samples.


### Build & Run

Each directory contains descriptive readme files to describe the code available and how it is used. The cloud-automation-samples team also creates white papers, blogs, and videos describing the purpose of and how to use the code available in this project. For more information you can review the documentation at the Cloud Automation Services website (https://cloud.vmware.com/cloud-automation-services/resources).
